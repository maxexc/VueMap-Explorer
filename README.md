## Open API Swagger Documentation

This project integrated with a **Node/Express** backend providing **Open API** includes **Swagger** UI documentation.

- **Open API (Swagger) on Render:**
  [https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com/api-docs](https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com/api-docs) ‚úî

- **Production Server (Render):**
  [https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com](https://backend-vue-map-explorer.onrender.com) üåç

All endpoints are described in `swagger.json`, covering
**User, Points, Routes,** and more. You can test requests directly in the
browser using the ‚ÄúTry it out‚Äù button, but note that you must provide a valid
**Bearer token** for protected routes.

**Important**: If you‚Äôre dealing with very large data (e.g. tens of thousands of
coordinates), Swagger UI may lag while rendering the JSON response. In such
cases, Postman or cURL might be more responsive for heavy payloads.

## Features

- **3D Routes & Custom Markers**:  
  Powered by [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/). Easily add, edit, or remove markers and see 3D transitions for routes.

- **Mobile First and Adaptive UI**:
  Tailored for phones and tablets ‚Äì the app also runs great on desktops/laptops for advanced tasks.
  Designed based on real-world user experiences on mobile/tablet devices.

- **Responsive & iOS-Optimized**:  
  Special care for iPhone/iPad (safe-area insets, orientation fix, etc.). PWA with black-translucent status bar.

- **Pinia State Management**:  
  Coordinates user sessions, active route data, and iOS detection (`isIOS`) for dynamic UI.

- **Swiper Cards**:  
  Swipe through points of interest in a sliding gallery. Overcame iOS quirks for clickable side slides.

- **Secure Auth (JWT)**:  
  Connects to a Node/Express backend using Bearer tokens. Protected routes for user-based markers.

- **Offline-Ready**:  
  Deployed as a PWA. Install on mobile devices and continue exploring even without network.
